<div class="card"><p>Suzy painted my bump when I was 35 weeks pregnant. She did a really lovely bespoke design based on a discussion with my husband and I. It was so lovely I didn't want to take it off! She picked out our ideas and interests and put them together in a beautiful picture. This art work was amazing and very original. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience and we now have some lovely photos to go in our baby book. I would thoroughly recommend you try it!</p>

<div class="card"><p>Suzanna was absolutely brilliant, so kind and friendly, very patient to our chaos at our 5 year olds birthday. She made sure every child had a chance to get their face painted, which was lovely especially for the children who were shy to approach. The face paint itself was fantastic, every child happy and all the parents thought it was amazing too. I will be recommending her to everyone I know and definitely be hiring again in future !!</p>
